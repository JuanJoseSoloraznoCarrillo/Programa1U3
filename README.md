# Java Methods Example

## Overview

This project is a school exercise designed to help students learn the Java programming language by demonstrating the use of constructors and methods in a Java class. The `Metodos` class contains multiple constructors that initialize variables and perform calculations based on the input parameters.

## Description

The `Metodos` class is part of the `rangonumerico` package and includes the following features:

- **Default Constructor**: Initializes the variables `x1`, `x2`, `i`, and `j` with default values and calculates the number of negative and positive numbers in the range.
- **Constructor with One Argument**: Initializes the variables `x2`, `i`, and `j`, and calculates the number of negative and positive numbers based on the input parameter `x1`.
- **Constructor with Two Arguments**: Initializes the variables `i` and `j`, and calculates the number of negative and positive numbers based on the input parameters `x1` and `x2`.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to define and use constructors in a Java class.
- Learn how to perform calculations and print results within constructors.
- Gain experience with conditional statements and loops in Java.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Compile and run the `Metodos` class to see the output of the different constructors.
